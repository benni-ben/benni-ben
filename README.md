## Hi. I am *ben*

`I am interested in web development(and web design) and silly games/websites. Also interested in 3d, Roblox building, animation, rigging, and other forms of art.`

`I like eaglercraft, modding, and I like making dumb shit that looks like it had a lot of effort put in(as well as making portable websites).`

`Currently available to help with 3d, UI design, or anything art-related. I am experienced in Autodesk Fusion, Blender, Roblox Studio, Daz3d, Adobe Illustrator, and I am extremely experienced in Google Color Picker.`

`Some of the interesting stuff that I have made that I am proud of:`

(I would add more, but fucking GitHub does not want me uploading 100mb images!)

`Oh, I am also a male.`

`I have Discord, Roblox, Reddit, and more.`

If you'd like to reach out to me on Discord, my Discord username is *@benpolb*.
